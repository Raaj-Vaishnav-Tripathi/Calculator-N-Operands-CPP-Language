# Simple_Calculator-N-Operands_CPP_Language
This is completely C++ language based Project which can perform 4 major operations of basic Calculator which are:- Addition , Subtraction, Division &amp; Multiplication.
The main difference is that it can take the number of operands input by the user &amp; it can then perform the selected operation on all operands provided till the nth
operand. I just took the number of Operands input by user in integer variable "n" and then created a array named Operands of size "n". Then I used Switch cases for all
four Arithematic operations :- +, -, *, /. I also used for loops inside all switch cases for iterating every operands in Operand array and used some conditional statements.


I have one Respository with same project implemented completely in C Language.
